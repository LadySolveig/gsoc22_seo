# Meta Data Plugin
This plugin gives Joomla content creators the ability to customize their articleâ€™s meta data. Meta data helps search engines determine the relevance of articles before displaying them in search results.

Though the page's content plays a major role in its ranking on search engines, customising its metadata is equally important. This makes it easier for search engines to accurately determine the page's purpose, skipping all the guesswork.

Some of the important meta data parameters include the following.
- Article Browser Title
- Article Meta Description
- Robots
- Content Rights
- Article Author

These parameters can be updated by going to the article's backend.
