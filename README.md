# Previews Plugin
This plugin Provides Joomla content creators a glimpse of how the article will appear to the end users on Google search engines. It becomes extremely important for the content creator to customize this piece of information as there is limited space available.

It can also be thought of as a small advertisement for the Joomla user’s content to attract potential leads.

There are four main parameters that are displayed in the preview. These include the following
- Article URL
- Article Title
- Article Description
- Published Date

Customising each of these parameters can boost the article’s click rate significantly. The plugin currently demonstrates the Article’s SERP Preview for both mobile as well as desktop view.

Here’s what that looks like
