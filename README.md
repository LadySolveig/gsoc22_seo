# Content Analysis Plugin
This plugin helps Joomla content creators improve their article's readability and click rate.<br>
There are five different features combined in this plugin, that highlights the aspects of the article that need improvement and also provides suggestions for refinement.
Along with suggestions, this plugin also highlights the importance for each parameter.
Some of these parameters include the article title, meta description, article word count, paragraph structure and sentence structure. 

The article's title and meta description are important parameters.
These are the first to be noticed by end users when an article shows up on search engines. 
So it becomes extremely important for the content creator to customize this piece of information as there is limited space available.
This plugin helps the Joomla content creator improve these parameters.<br>
The article's title length directly impacts SEO and so has the highest importance (4).
But the article's word count may vary depending on the type of content the user wants to publish. So there isn't any fixed limit on how long they should be. 
This is the reason why it has the least importance (2).

Also having a concise paragraph structure is ideal for SEO and also improves the article's readability especially on smaller screens.
Ideal paragraph structures improve an article's searchability on search engines.
This feature assists in keeping article paragraphs short and easy to read for viewers.
It will list down the top 5 paragraphs that exceed the word limit.
Currently the limit for each paragraph has been set to a maximum of 200 words.

A similar functionality has been included for the article's sentences to help keep them concise.
The limit for each sentence has been set to a maximum of 20 words.<br>
Assuming long sentences are a bigger problem for readers than long paragraphs, I've assigned a higher importance value (4) to sentences and slightly lower to paragraphs (3).

Here's a screenshot demonstrating this.
