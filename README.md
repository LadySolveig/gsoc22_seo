# Readability Rating Plugin
This plugin helps Joomla content creators analyse the article and provide a score based on its readability and difficulty level.

The scoring is based on the universally accepted Flesch Kincaid Score. Here's how to interpret it.

| Range | Interpretation |
| :---: | :---: |
| 0 - 10	| Extremely difficult to read |
| 10 - 30	| Very difficult to read |
| 30 - 50	| Difficult to read |
| 50 - 60	| Fairly difficult to read
| 60 - 70	| Plain English |
| 70 - 80	| Fairly easy to read |
| 80 - 90	| Easy to read |
| 90 - 100 |	Very easy to read |

Rather than simply relying on a rating, the target audience should also be considered before making changes.<br>
For instance, an academic article may typically have a lower rating (a significantly high difficulty level for average readers) but the target audience (university grads) wonâ€™t find it too difficult to comprehend.

Here's a demonstration of this feature.
